Specifically, we use knowledge of React components, passing state, and requests with the Spotify API to build this website that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.

>This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
